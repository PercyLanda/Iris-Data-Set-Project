# OVERVIEW
This repository has been created for me to record and show my work as I build and submit ny findings and project for the required area.
I created a gitignore and a LICENCE (Apache) based on my knowledge of creating my original repository for my weekly course tasks.

After completing the necessary research for this project, I come to see similar points being made about the Iris Data Set through numerous projects completed by individuals:  
- This is a popular data set for use within Machine Learning
- Due to its small size (4 algorithms and 150 rows) it easily fits into memory (and on an A4 page) *{ https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/ }
