<h2><strong> 1.	Introduction </h2></strong> <br>

The purpose of this project is to investigate "The Iris Flower Data Set" [1] and prove my understanding of the data set and explain its importance to machine learning. I intend to investigate, research and produce my findings via this submission. My goal for this project is to provide education within the field of machine learning so as to provide knowledge to those interested in understanding it in more detail.
This project has been approached with the intention of researching all information of the Irish Flower Data Set, write and run scripts to test the set within Python and provide written support of my view of the data set.

<h2><strong> 1.2) Technology Used</h2></strong> <br>

For this project I heavy utilized the Python Programming Language [1] , GitHub [2] along with various online resources which have been referenced at each mention. To complete any of the codes I have mentioned in this project, you can install Anaconda [3]. { [1] https://www.python.org/ , [2] https://github.com/ ,  [3] https://www.anaconda.com/ } </br>

<h2><strong>2. Discussion</h2></strong> <br>
<h2><strong>2.1 Background</h2></strong> <br>


The Iris Flower Data Set was created by Ronald Fisher in 1936. It is described as a multivariate data set as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is a data set which consists of 50 samples taken from three species of the Iris flower. The four features used for this data set include the length and width of the sepals and petals.

The background and the creation of the Iris Flower Data Set is documented on the Wikipedia page for this topic [1]:
“The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper “The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems” as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.”

The Iris Flower Data Set itself has become an extremely popular tool to test machine learning 
 
<h2><strong>2.2 Preparation</h2></strong> <br>

Prior to writing and running any scripts, you will want to ensure that the required software is installed. For this project I have used the software called Anaconda. I have used this software throughout my course to date and find it extremely user-friendly. Anaconda can be downloaded via: ‘https://www.anaconda.com/’.

During my research, I found a website tutorial which provides a step-by-step guide preparation guide for beginners to Machine Learning with Python and also runs similar scripts to what I was wanting to achieve in my own project. You will see further references of this site throughout my project where I will work with and add to those scripts to create my own outputs: [1] - https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/

Once Anaconda is installed, it is beneficial to check that the necessary libraries were also successfully installed. The below screenshot shows the output from Python containing the information of the libraries and the running software version of each:



<h2><strong>2.3 Investigation</h2></strong> <br>



# OVERVIEW
This repository has been created for me to record and show my work as I build and submit ny findings and project for the required area.
I created a gitignore and a LICENCE (Apache) based on my knowledge of creating my original repository for my weekly course tasks.

After completing the necessary research for this project, I come to see similar points being made about the Iris Data Set through numerous projects completed by individuals:  
- This is a popular data set for use within Machine Learning
- Due to its small size (4 algorithms and 150 rows) it easily fits into memory (and on an A4 page) *{ https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/ }
